She not only is an amazing hairdresser/barber she is a one of a kind woman and friend. This has always been her dream and I am so happy it is coming true. I told her I would follow her to Egypt if I had to... but it looks like Brookhaven it is. Congrats my gypsy... you did it! I love u so very much."</li>
