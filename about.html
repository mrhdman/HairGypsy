    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>I specialize in mens cuts.  All the way from hipster to biz professional.   I worked in downtown Decatur at a barbershop for 2 years doing all the latest mens hipster cuts. I worked in Peachtree City for 15 years in full service salons.  I decided 5 years ago to switch to cutting only mens hair, it changed my life!  
        I'm so excited to join Salon Lofts and have the freedom to create the perfect atmosphere that I have wanted to provide for my clients for years!  Cheers! 
        New women cuts and color clients will need an initial consultation before booking appointments. </p>

    <h1>Testimonials</h1>
    <p>Rachel has been doing my hair for the past 6 years. I have followed her to every location she has worked at. She not only is an amazing hairdresser/barber she is a one of a kind woman and friend. This has always been her dream and I am so happy it is coming true. I told her I would follow her to Egypt if I had to... but it looks like Brookhaven it is. Congrats my gypsy... you did it! I love u so very much.</p>
