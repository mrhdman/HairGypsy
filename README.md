# HairGypsy
The purpose of this website is to promote the Hair Gypsy brand.

Layout:
1. Each page is marked up in HTML and styled using plain CSS.
2. Each page is linked in the navbar located at the top of each page.

Functionality:
1. On the contact page, we used the Google maps API to get directions to the actual salon using the jQuery framework for the api requests.
2. Every page has a book now link that will take the user directly to the booking page where they can schedule salon services.
3. On the gallery page, we used slick slider to automate the picture transitions.
